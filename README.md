# Production & Warehouse Scrap Report

## Overview
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of scrap across production lines for the year 2024, focusing on both cost and quantity perspectives. It is divided into two main pages:
1. **Scrap Overview** ‚Äì high-level KPIs, trends, and distributions.
2. **Defect Drilldown** ‚Äì detailed breakdown by defect categories and cost centers.

The dataset is based on **anonymized data from a real manufacturing company**, enriched with **synthetic data on produced units** to preserve internal data confidentiality while enabling relevant scrap rate calculations.
